// 3 operations in the code below. Be aware of the number of operations in terms of time in executing code((( the operations are {*, +, /})))
// function addUpTo(n) {
//   return n * (n + 1) / 2;
// }

//===========================================================
// "n" is the assignment and the operations happen one time per assignment. Depends on the loop.
// function addUpTo(n) {
//   let total = 0;
//   for (let i = 1; i <= n; i++) {
//     total += i;
//   }
//   return total;
// }

//Depending on what we Count, the number of operations can be as low as 2n or as high as 5n+2

//But regardless of the exact number, the number of operations grows roughly proportionally with n

// Execution of loops are not effecient
