//=====================================================================
// Write a function which takes two numbers and returns their sum.

// 1. Can I restate the problem in my own words?
//-- Implement addition
// 2. What are the inputs that go into the problem?
// -- ints?
// -- floats?
// -- what about string for large numbers?
// 3. What are the outputs that should come from the solution to the problem?
// -- ints?
// -- floats?
// -- strings?
