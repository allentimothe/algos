// Does that sound crazy?
// Do you think this will work?

// Can possibly get hints

// write a function which takes in a string and returns counts of each character in the string...

function charCount(str) {
  // Make an object
  // loop over string for each character
    //if the char is a number/ letter AND is a key in object, add one to count
    // if the char is a number/ letter AND not in object, add it to object and set value to 1
    // if character is something else (space, period, etc.) dont do anything 
  // return object at end
}
